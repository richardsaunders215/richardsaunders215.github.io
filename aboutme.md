My name is Richard Saunders and I am an aspiring Cybersecurity and AI professional. Currently I am seeking remote entry level in either field, as I am really excited to take myself on the road to professional growth. 

### My story

To be honest, I started off as a assitant project manageer and data analytics. So I started off just learning more and more about the technical skills within the Cybersecurity and AI field. I have created a LinkedIn newsletter that has reached 153 subscribers. I just use it to showcase my learnings along the way and also give tutorials to help people navigate through some interesting software.
